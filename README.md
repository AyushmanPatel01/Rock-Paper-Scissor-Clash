Code Explanation
The game works by:

Prompting the user to enter their choice of "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
The computer then randomly selects its choice.
The program compares the user’s input to the computer’s choice and determines the winner based on the standard rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock
The result is then printed on the screen.
